# FilmotekaCentralService

FilmotekaCentralService is a script to make it easier to run the [Filmoteka](https://github.com/LorakPL/Filmoteka) project on your Linux device (e.g. single-board computer - Raspberry Pi).

Once you run the script on your device, it will be checked:
- **MySQL**
- **Tomcat**
- **Java**

If it turns out that you do not have these tools, the script will install them automatically.

## Getting Started
If you are in the folder with the startService.sh file just enter the command:

```
sudo ./startService.sh
```



## Tools
- **Java** - version 8
- **Tomcat** - version 7
- **MySQL** - newest version
